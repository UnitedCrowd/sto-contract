United Token Features
Freezable Accounts
Any user account can be frozen/unfrozen by the admin.
Call the freezeAccount(address _target) & unFreezeAccount(address _target) function
respectively.
Pausable Contract
All token transfers among any users can be paused/un-paused by the admin in case of an unforeseen
circumstance.
Call the pause() & unPause() function respectively.
Vest Tokens to An Independent Address
Admin can create vesting schedules for users, such that the tokens are not given out immediately, but are
distributed over a period of time in small quantities. The tokens are stored in an independent address until they
vest.
The following functionality is available to the admin:
● Create a vesting schedule: grantVestedTokens(address beneficiary, uint
fullyVestedAmount, uint startDate, uint cliffSec, uint durationSec, bool
isRevokable)
● Remove a vesting schedule: revokeVesting(address beneficiary)
The following functionality is available to a user:
● Withdraw vested tokens if any: releaseVestedTokens(address beneficiary)
Dividend paying tokens
Admin can send the profit earned to the contract (in Ether) using the addDividend() function.
This is then automatically distributed among the current token holders the next time they send/recieve a
payment. In the ratio of the number of tokens they hold. No additional function needs to be called by the users.
